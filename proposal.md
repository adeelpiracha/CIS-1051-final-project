# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Flappy Bird Remastered

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks

A game like flappy bird, being able to contol birds flaps to fly through obstacles

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Ive always liked games and one i can remember being very popoular for a little while was flappy bird. So i think it would be cool to be able to recreate it myself. I will have the user able to control the height at which the bird jumps up and have that set at a certain #. There will be set obstacles in the setting at random heights but to leave enough gap for the bird to fit through.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

having an object(the bird) be able to be controlled through an action(space button) and have the obstacles set in place

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Having a high score tracker and having little to no errors in the game to the point where I will be playing it for fun while im bored in a class

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

 Haivng maybe even more than one level in the game and maybe more maps to play on with differnet backgroungs and maybe being able to choose between different characters with different jump abilities

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to learn more about how to have a object move and jump from a user pressing a button. while also having the background move as well when playing through the game. I will also have to learn how to make the obstacles the way it is in the game where there are two pillar like objects facing each other but at different heights each time. Then also keeping record of scores and having a high score shown on the screen.
